        <p>
          Just a curious young man from a small village in Ghana who found his passion in data and discovery.
          Growing up without access to a computer, I completed junior high school having only seen computers
          drawn on a blackboard. But that did not stop me — I was determined to learn, grow, and change my story.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, I use data to uncover patterns, communicate insight, and support better decision-making.
          I work with <strong>Python, Excel, R, SQL, Power BI</strong>, and <strong>QGIS</strong>, and I’ve contributed to projects involving
          predictive modeling, real estate valuation, and spatial optimization.
        </p>

        <p>
          My mission is simple: to use data to solve real-world problems — from housing equity and business strategy
          to policy and smarter cities. I believe data can help build fairer outcomes, and I’m committed to doing work that matters.
